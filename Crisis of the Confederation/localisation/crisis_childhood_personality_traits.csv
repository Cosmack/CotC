EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION0;You feel like you're constantly under intense pressure. You can never seem to think straight, and you never seem to be good enough at anything you do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION0;Somebody help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION1;Of late, your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] seems to be growing increasingly anxious, especially around you, terrified that anything [From.GetSheHe] does is wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION1;Maybe I was too hard on [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION10;There's nothing you like more than fresh experiences. You love to explore and experiment, and you drive your teachers mad by listening eagerly to lessons, then wandering off bored during review.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION10;The world is so big!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION10;Hey, want to see this cool new bug I caught?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION11;reacts to your newfound curiosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION11;You [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName] is an inquisitive young [From.GetGirlBoy]. Just this morning, [From.GetSheHe] showed you some strange insect [From.GetSheHe] found while crawling around the ventilation system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION11;Encourage [From.GetFirstName]'s curiosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION11;Warn [From.GetHerHim] about unexpected dangers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION11;Scold [From.GetFirstName] for going off on [From.GetHerHis] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION12;Your [GetFromRelation] grinned when you showed [From.GetHerHim] the fruits of your explorations, and even helped you trace the bug back to its hive in the air vents!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION12;I wonder what else there is to find?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION13;When you told your [GetFromRelation] about the bug you found while exploring the air vents, [From.GetHerHis] face turned pale, and [From.GetSheHe] took you aside and explained to you how dangerous it is to go crawling out of sight like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION13;Curiosity killed the cat...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION14;Your [GetFromRelation]'s face turned pale when you told [From.GetHerHim] about how you'd been exploring the air vents. [From.GetSheHeCap] knelt down next to you, and told you how worried [From.GetSheHe] would be if anything happened to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION14;I'm sorry, it won't happen again, I promise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION15;Your [GetFromRelation] just doesn't appreciate the finer things in life. [From.GetSheHeCap] keeps saying that exploring the air vents or running off out of sight is dangerous, but what does [From.GetSheHe] know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION15;I wonder what beer tastes like...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION16;Your [GetFromRelation] was furious when you told [From.GetHerHim] about the bug you'd found exploring the air vents. [From.GetSheHeCap] grounded you for a week and made you promise never to do any such thing again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION16;I guess some things just aren't worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION17;Your [GetFromRelation] was furious when you told [From.GetHerHim] about the bug you'd found exploring the air vents. [From.GetSheHeCap] grounded you for a week and made you promise never to do any such thing again. Later that night, you snuck out of your bedroom anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION17;What does [From.GetSheHe] know, anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION18;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] is much more cautious now, and shouldn't run into any more dangerous situations in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION18;Maybe even a little too cautious?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION18;At least [From.GetSheHe]'ll be safe from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION19;You thought you'd convinced [From.GetFirstName] of your concerns, but you don't think [From.GetSheHe] really took them to heart. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems more adventurous now than ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION19;What am I ever going to do with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION20;The other children sometimes call you a coward, but you aren't, not really. You're just sensible. Why go looking for trouble? Why try to fix things that aren't broken? Won't you just end up making things worse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION20;I want things to stay just the way they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION20;I don't WANT to go the park, I want to stay home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION21;reacts to your newfound cautiousness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION21;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been growing more cautious and conservative lately. Today, when you told [From.GetHerHim] that you were going to the park, you thought [From.GetSheHe]'d be excited, but instead [From.GetSheHe] insisted that [From.GetSheHe] just wanted to stay home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION21;Encourage [From.GetFirstName]'s caution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION21;Try to persuade [From.GetFirstName] to take more risks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION21;Punish [From.GetFirstName] for [From.GetHerHis] cowardice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION22;You were expecting your [GetFromRelation] to be angry when you refused to go to the park with [From.GetHerHim], but actually, [From.GetSheHe] was quite pleased! [From.GetSheHeCap] appears to approve of your wisdom and caution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION22;Safety first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION23;When you refused to go to the park, your [GetFromRelation] knelt down next to you and explained about the importance of trying new things. For the first time, you began to wonder if your caution was letting the world pass you by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION23;Nothing ventured, nothing gained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION24;When you refused to go to the park, your [GetFromRelation] knelt down next to you and started talking about how important it was to try new things. It took a while, but you finally begrudgingly agreed that maybe sometimes a little bit of risk was worthwhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION24;It can't be that bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION25;Your [GetFromRelation] is just as bad as the other children! When you refused to go to the park, [From.GetSheHe] started talking about how you should be willing to take risks and try new things, but it's clear that [From.GetSheHe] had no idea what [From.GetSheHe] was talking about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION25;I'm staying right here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION26;Your [GetFromRelation] was furious when you refused to go to the park. [From.GetSheHeCap] practically dragged you from your room and pulled you all the way there. You spent the entire afternoon outside against your will - but in hindsight, it wasn't as bad as you'd feared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION26;Maybe I was just a coward after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION27;Your [GetFromRelation] was furious when you refused to go to the park. [From.GetSheHeCap] practically dragged you from your room and pulled you all the way there. You spent the entire afternoon in grudging misery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION27;This is the worst day of my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION28;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] may not have been too eager to jump into things at first, but [From.GetSheHe] seems more than willing to experiment now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION28;[From.GetSheHeCap] actually seems to enjoy it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION28;At least [From.GetSheHe]'s getting some fresh air..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION29;It's no use. No matter what you do, [From.GetFirstName] stubbornly refuses to leave the safety of [From.GetHerHis] quarters. You eventually dragged [From.GetHerHim] down to the park, but [From.GetSheHe] spent the entire cycle fuming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION29;What am I going to do with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION30;You're a model student at school, and you diligently do your chores at home. Some of your friends tease you and call you a teacher's pet, but you're just doing what you're asked to do, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION30;I'm a good [Root.GetGirlBoy].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCHILDHOODEDUCATION31;reacts to your newfound discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION31;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], is a model student, and [From.GetSheHe] always diligently does [From.GetHerHis] chores. You've never seen a more dutiful and responsible child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION31;Reward [From.GetFirstName]'s good behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION31;Try to persuade [From.GetFirstName] to loosen up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCHILDHOODEDUCATION31;Punish [From.GetFirstName] for [From.GetHerHis] brown-nosing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION32;Your [GetFromRelation] is exceptionally pleased with your good behavior - this morning, [From.GetSheHe] even bought you a brand new holosuite as a reward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION32;Hard work is the path to success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION33;You were surprised when your [GetFromRelation] came into your room this evening and sat down beside you. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that [From.GetSheHe] was worried about you - that [From.GetSheHe] thought you might be working yourself to hard. [From.GetSheCap] said that [From.GetSheHe] was worried you might burn yourself out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION33;I'm sorry! I promise I'll relax from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION34;Your [GetFromRelation] seemed mostly please with your hard work, but [From.GetSheHe] also seemed a bit worried. [From.GetSheHeCap] explained to you that while hard work is important, so is pacing yourself to make sure you don't burn out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION34;I guess [From.GetSheHe]'s right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION35;Your [GetFromRelation] doesn't seem to appreciate your good behavior at all! [From.GetSheHeCap] said that you should take a break and relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION35;Maybe it's some kind of test?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION36;You're so confused! You'd thought you were making your [GetFromRelation] happy, but just this morning, [From.GetSheHe] grounded you for a week! It almost seems like [From.GetSheHe] resents your hard work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION36;This isn't worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION37;You're so confused! You'd thought you were making your [GetFromRelation] happy, but just this morning, [From.GetSheHe] grounded you for a week! Maybe you weren't as well-behaved as you thought?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION37;I'll have to try harder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION38;It seems that did the trick. [From.GetFirstName] is no longer anywhere near as wound up, and seems happy to take things easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION38;Maybe a little too happy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCHILDHOODEDUCATION38;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHILDHOODEDUCATION39;You've accomplished nothing. [From.GetFirstName] is just as rigorous and disciplined as ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACHILDHOODEDUCATION39;I'll just have to live with it, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
