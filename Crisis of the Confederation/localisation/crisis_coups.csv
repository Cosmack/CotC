A coup would currently be considered justified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP5000;You peer over an intelligence report, fingers drumming idly on your desk. You have prepared carefully, but the fall of a [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitle] is no small matter. Has the time truly come to strike?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP5001;Your plans will be set in motion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP5001;You fold dismiss the intelligence report with a wave of your hand, and turn to the comm center. You are more full of conviction now then you have ever been before. Tonight, [Root.PlotTarget.GetFullName] falls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP5001;Send [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] your ultimatum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCOUP5101;Something stirs in the darkness. You blink, and the world begins to come back into focus. Your head is pounding, and you can feel a sharp pain in your side, but you're alive, at least. As you finally start to get your bearings, it hits you with a shock - you're in the brig aboard your own flagship, the [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] - although you're beginning to suspect you won't be calling it your flagship again any time soon. You look down, and see that you've been placed in handcuffs. It seems that your enemies have won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP5200;receives your ultimatum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP5200;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [FROM.GetFullName]\nRE: New management\nIt's time we brought this farce to a close. You are no longer fit to serve as [Root.GetTitle]. We demand that you tender your immediate resignation. If you've any love left for the people you've betrayed, you'll stand down, and spare them death at the hands of your butchers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP5201;will take you prisoner and usurp the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] and all other titles of its tier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBACKSCOUP;has already declared [This.GetHerHis] support for the coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP5201;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetFullName]\nRE: New management\nYou win, you snake. For the sake of peace, I hereby surrender the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] to you. May its people forgive me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP5202;and [This.GetHerHis] supporters might start a civil war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP5202;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetFullName]\nRE: New management\nNever! Even if you tear [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] asunder, you'll never be able to do as much damage to my people with missiles as you could with my title. You and your followers are traitors, and will be dealt with as such.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP5202;Then war it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCOUP5202;...damn, I was really hoping that would work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP5300;You march, triumphantly, into [Root.PlotTarget.GetFullName]'s palace. [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] former palace, at any rate. Scum though [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] was, [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] at least had good sense in interior decorators. You think you're going to like it here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP5300;Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCOUP5300;Victory is mine! ...I mean ours. Victory is ours. Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP5301;will surrender the [This.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] and all other titles of its tier to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP5301;It's over. [From.GetFullName] has beaten you. Your last remaining supporters have surrendered, and you remain [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s prisoner. Your title has been stripped from you, though you have been permitted to keep nominal control over some of your family holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECOUP102;Operation [FromFrom.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP100;At your request, your chief-of-staff has prepared several reports for you documenting security arrangements at [Root.Liege.GetTitle] [Root.Liege.GetFullName]'s estate, as well as the best ways a team of marines could be deployed to the capital on less than a day's notice. A swift attack on the palace could be all it takes to capture the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] and bring [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] regime to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP100;A brilliant plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP101;will be informed of your plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP101;TO: [Root.GetTitle] [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetTitle] [From.GetFullName]\nRE: Prior arrangements\nSeveral of my friends and I are all within easy reach of the capital, once you have seen to matters on your end. I await only your invitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP101;The [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitle] will never see it coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP102;Due to a change in circumstances, you are no longer able to carry out your planned military coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP103;will be informed that your plans have been called off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP103;Due to a change in circumstances, [From.GetTitle] [From.GetFullName] is no longer able to carry out [From.GetHerHis] planned military coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP104;The time has come. [Root.Liege.GetTitle] [Root.Liege.GetFullName] has ruled the [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] for too long! You have been given the honor of carrying out the first blow in the struggle that will mark the end of [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] reign. As night settles over the capital, you give the order, and your forces begin to move to their positions. The dawn will bring with it a new regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP104;You have your orders, marines. Move out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP105;will be attacked by your forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP130;Something's wrong. You'd had your suspicions for a while now - it was just little things at first, [From.GetTitle] [From.GetFullName] returning to the capital more frequently than usual, odd troop movements, that sort of thing, but tonight your own personnel are reporting something very strange indeed. [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s forces are moving out, in force. It's almost as if they're converging on the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s palace, but that can't be right, could it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP130;[Root.job_marshal.GetOnlyDynastyName], prepare our forces to intercept them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCOUP130;It's nothing, let them go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP107;You stand in your command center, leaning over a holotank console, listening to reports filter in from the capital. You could cut the tension with a knife. Early combat reports were only sporadic, but it's only a matter of time before someone realizes what your marines are up to. That is, until a flickering image of a marine captain appears in the air before you.\n\n'[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], he says, 'we've got [FromFrom.GetHerHim]. We're returning to command now.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP107;Well done, captain, mission accomplished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP108;An explosion rocks you from your sleep.\n\nYou sit up, still not quite awake. It's the middle of the night, and you're beginning to wonder just what the hell that noise was. You almost think you hear gunfire, but that would be absurd, wouldn't it?\n\nA loud bang catches your attention, and you turn to see the entrance to your quarters slide open and a junior aide step through, only to fall immediately to the ground, blood pouring from [Root.job_chancellor.GetHerHis] chest. The [From.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] marine behind [Root.job_chancellor.GetHerHim] walks into the room and pulls you from your bed before tapping [From.GetHerHis] comlink.\n\n'[From.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], we've got [Root.GetHerHim].';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP108;This... this is treason! I'll have your head for this, [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP109;is pleased with your success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP109;TO: [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitle] [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM:[From.GetTitle] [From.GetFullName]\nRE: Operation [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]\nMy forces have secured the package. [Root.PlotTarget.GetOnlyDynastyName] is in custody and being transferred to your custody now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP109;Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP110;It seems [From.GetTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] was a useful ally after all - last night, [From.GetHerHis] forces stormed the capital, and captured the [From.Liege.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP110;Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP111;You awake to find the world upside-down. It seems that in the night, forces under [From.GetTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s command infiltrated the capital and captured the [From.Liege.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP132;You order your troops to mobilize and defend the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] - but in the end, you were too late. By the time your forces could reinforce the capital, [From.GetTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s attack force had already seized the palace and captured the [Root.Liege.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP132;We were too late!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP112;You stand in your command center, leaning over a holotank console, listening to reports filter in from the capital. You could cut the tension with a knife. Early combat reports were only sporadic, but it's only a matter of time before someone realizes what your marines are up to. That is, until a flickering image of a marine captain appears in the air before you.\n\n'[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]! [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], [FromFrom.GetSheHe]'s not here! [FromFrom.GetSheCap] got away!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP112;Then FIND [FromFrom.GetHerHim]! NOW!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP113;escapes to a secure location!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP113;A pleasant night's sleep is cut short by someone shaking you awake. You manage to stir yourself to consciousness, making out the vague form of one of your junior aides. 'It's important, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],' [Root.job_chancellor.GetSheHe] says in a hushed whisper.\n\nYou manage to regain enough clarity to ask for details. 'It's... it's the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName],' [Root.job_chancellor.GetSheHe] says, 'security caught one of their SpecOps teams on the palace grounds, planting explosives. [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s already landed an armor column. We need to get you to a secure location right now, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP113;So it's come to this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP114;is disappointed with your failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP114;TO: [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitle] [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetTitle] [From.GetFullName]\nRE: Operation [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]\nI regret to inform you that our efforts to capture [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitle] [Root.PlotTarget.GetOnlyDynastyName] have ended in failure. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHeCap] has escaped our sweep of the capital and retreated to a secure location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP114;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP115;Last night, [From.GetTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s forces stormed the capital in an attempt to capture [From.Liege.GetTitle] [From.Liege.GetFullName], but they have failed, and [From.Liege.GetOnlyDynastyName] has retreated to a secure location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP133;You enter your war room, ready to assume full command of your forces in the hunt for [Root.Liege.GetTitle] [Root.Liege.GetFullName]. Unfortunately, your command staff are in disarray, and barely even notice your arrival. You track down your chief-of-staff and demand a situation report.\n\n'[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]!' [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHe] stammers, 'Bad news, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]! The marines you called for, they... they were intercepted on their way to the capital! We're trying to break through, but...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP133;WHAT?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP134;'s forces have intercepted yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP134;The first report comes in less than an hour. 'We captured a [From.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] SpecOps team, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],' a flickering hologram of a marine captain informs you, 'and we found several explosive charges and a datapad with a map and the security details of the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s palace. I... I think they were planning to kidnap the [Root.Liege.GetTitle, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA].'\n\nYou only have a few seconds to ponder this revelation before your chief-of-staff turns to you. '[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]!' [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHe] says, 'A [From.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] armor column just moved out, they're heading for the palace!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP134;All units, secure the capital! We must defend the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP135;A pleasant night's sleep is cut short by someone shaking you awake. You manage to stir yourself to consciousness, making out the uniform of a [From.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] marine. 'Are you awake now, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]?' [From.GetSheHe] asks, 'We need to move, now.'\n\nYou climb groggily to your feet, the marine helping you with one arm. 'We intercepted a [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective SpecOps team,' [From.GetSheHe] explains, 'they were planning to storm the palace and capture you. They have an armor column on its way to the palace now. [From.GetTitle] [From.GetFullName] wants us to get you to a secure location immediately.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP135;It's too damn early for this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP136;TO: [Root.GetTitle] [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [FromFrom.GetTitle] [FromFrom.GetFullName]\nRE: Operation [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]\nMy forces have entered the capital, but we've been intercepted by loyalists under [From.GetTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]. I don't think we're going to make it in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP136;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP137;Last night, [FromFrom.GetTitle] [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s forces stormed the capital in an attempt to capture [FromFrom.Liege.GetTitle] [FromFrom.Liege.GetFullName], but they were thwarted by the intervention of [From.GetTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] and the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. The [FromFrom.Liege.GetTitle] has retreated to a secure location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP117;Thus far, your coup has not been a resounding success. The [Root.Liege.GetTitle] has retreated to a secure location, and all attempts to penetrate the bunker have failed. At the moment, however, you hold a key advantage - the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] still believes you and your forces are loyal. The time has come to disabuse [Root.Liege.HerHim] of that notion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP139;The [Root.Liege.GetTitle] is secure in [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] bunker, but the battle is not over yet. Pouring over the formation of troops defending the bunker, you realize that several units from the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] appear to be falling back - and as far as you know, there's been no combat in [From.GetTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s sector.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP139;[From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s a traitor! Stop them, now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP120;Your forces pull back from the front lines, with the other defense commanders none the wiser. As an [Root.GetTitle], you personally possess the security clearance to access the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s bunker. A few comments about your security duties allay any suspicions as you march through the halls and enter into the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s command center. [Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] is bent over a holotank console, and turns around to greet you as you come in.\n\n'[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],' [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] says, extending a hand, 'I trust things are going well outside?'\n\nYou smirk and draw your sidearm, as your marines pour into the command center behind you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP120;They're certainly starting to look up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP121;You pace the war-room, growing increasingly concerned. You might have managed to escape the first wave, but who knows how far this conspiracy reached? You try to get ahold of yourself. Your bunker is secure - none of the traitors should be able to penetrate it.\n\nYou lean over a holotank console to survey the battlefield, when the entrance hatch slides open. You turn to see [From.GetFullName], one of the few [From.GetTitle]s to still remain loyal. '[From.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],' you say, extending a hand, 'I trust things are going well outside?'\n\n[From.GetSheCap] smirks, and extends [From.GetHerHis] own - and only now do you realize [From.GetSheHe] is holding a pistol. Armed marines pour in through the hatch behind [From.GetHerHim], leveling their rifles.\n\n'They're certainly starting to look up.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP121;[From.GetOnlyDynastyName], you snake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP122;TO: [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitle] [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM:[From.GetTitle] [From.GetFullName]\nRE: Operation [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]\nI have secured the package. [Root.PlotTarget.GetOnlyDynastyName] is in custody and being transferred to your custody now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP200;As head of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Intelligence, you are in direct control over a significant portion of the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s security aparatus. It would be all to easy to subvert that process, and turn the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s own security against [Root.Liege.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP200;[Root.Liege.GetHerHisCap] regime will soon be at end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP201;TO: [Root.GetTitle] [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetTitle] [From.GetFullName]\nRE: Security status\nI have recently conducted a full analysis of the [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitle]'s personal security measures, and wished to report that they are more than adequate per the concerns you raised in our earlier discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP201;Betrayed by [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] own bodyguards...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP202;Due to a change in circumstances, you are no longer able to subvert the intelligence service in the result of a coup..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP203;Due to a change in circumstances, [From.GetTitle] [From.GetFullName] is no longer able to subvert [Root.PlotTarget.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Intelligence in the event of a coup..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP204;You arrive at the palace under cover of night. You have been preparing things for some time, carefully arranging to ensure that the personnel posted to the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s security detail this night are loyal to you and you alone.\n\nYou enter a corridor, and nod subtly to two guards posted outside the main security room doors. They nod back, and unholster their rifles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP204;[Root.Liege.GetOnlyDynastyName] will be in our hands by sunrise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP205;will be caught in your trap.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP207;You and your men burst into the security room and quickly overwhelm the loyalist tech sergeant watching the dim security cameras. Very carefully, you explain to [Root.GetHerHim] that if [Root.GetSheHe] wants to keep [Root.GetHerHis] life, [Root.GetSheHe] will do exactly as you say. [Root.GetSheCap] gulps and nods, and you politely inform [Root.GetHerHim] that you would like to talk to the [Root.Liege.GetTitle].\n\nAfter a few minutes of waiting, [Root.Liege.GetFullName] walks into the security room, blissfully unaware. 'For [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s sake, [Root.GetFirstName],' [Root.GetSheHe] says, 'can't you handle... this... your... self?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP207;Men, take the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] into custody. Now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP208;You are about to retire for the evening when your personal comlink beeps. It's one of your security guards.\n\n'[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]?' [From.GetSheHe] asks nervously, 'there's something [From.GetTitle] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] would like to speak you about. [From.GetSheHeCap]'s down in the security room.'\n\nYou sigh, and make your way down to security, wondering why in the world [From.GetFirstName] couldn't handle this [From.GetHerHim]self. Opening the door to security, however, you are greeted with the answer - [From.GetFirstName] stands in the center of the security room, surrounded by Intelligence personnel - and all of them have rifles trained on you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP208;What's going on?! What's the meaning of this?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP210;It appears that [From.GetFullName] was a worthy asset after all. Last night, agents of [From.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Intelligence under [From.GetHerHis] command were able to capture [From.Liege.GetFullName] and deliver [From.Liege.GetHerHim] into your custody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP211;You awaken to find the world turned upside down. Apparently, last night, agents of [From.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Intelligence under the command of [From.GetFullName] were able to capture [From.Liege.GetFullName] and deliver [From.Liege.GetHerHim] into the custody of a group of like-minded traitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP212;You and your men burst into the security room and quickly overwhelm the loyalist tech sergeant watching the dim security cameras. Very carefully, you explain to [Root.GetHerHim] that if [Root.GetSheHe] wants to keep [Root.GetHerHis] life, [Root.GetSheHe] will do exactly as you say. [Root.GetSheCap] gulps and nods, and you politely inform [Root.GetHerHim] that you would like to talk to the [Root.Liege.GetTitle].\n\nUnfortunately, you let your attention turn away for a few crucial seconds.\n\n'[Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]!' the guard screams into the comlink, '[Root.GetFullName] has gone rogue! [Root.GetSheHeCap]'s in...'\n\nA well-placed bullet cuts the guard off, but the damage is already done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP212;Nothing can ever be easy, can it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP213;You are about to retire for the evening when your personal comlink beeps. It's one of your security guards.\n\n'[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]?' [From.GetSheHe] asks nervously, 'there's something...'\n\nThe voice hesistates for a second, and then suddenly returns, full of urgency. '[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]!' [From.GetSheHe] shouts, '[From.GetFullName] has gone rogue! [From.GetSheHeCap]'s in...' The voice is cut off by a gunshot.\n\nAll thoughts of sleep banished from you mind, you quickly reactive your comlink and call for an escort party of those whose loyalty is unquestionable. You need to get to your bunker. Now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP213;And then we'll get to the bottom of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP214;TO: [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitle] [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetTitle] [From.GetFullName]\nRE: Operation [From.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]\nI regret to inform you that our efforts to capture [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitle] [Root.PlotTarget.GetOnlyDynastyName] have ended in failure. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHeCap] has escaped my agents and retreated to a secure location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP215;[From.GetFullName] has failed. Last night, [From.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Intelligence agents under [From.GetHerHis] command attempted to capture [From.Liege.GetFullName], but they failed, and now the [From.Liege.GetTitle] has escaped to a secure location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP216;You awaken to find the [From.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] in chaos. Apparently, last night, [From.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Intelligence agents under the command of [From.GetFullName] attempted to capture [From.Liege.GetFullName], but failed, and the [From.Liege.GetTitle] has now retreated to a secure location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP217;You walk the halls of [Root.Liege.GetFullName]'s secure bunker, a team of your best agents at your heels. The [Root.Liege.GetTitle] retreated here after the first stages of the coup was bungled by the fools left in charge. You will not make the same mistake.\n\nYou arrive at the situation room, where the [Root.Liege.GetTitle] has been waiting patiently for your security briefing on the situation and any identified traitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP217;Trust me, it's going to be VERY informative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP220;You idly amuse yourself by presenting a slideshow on the room's holotank, passing through several of the fools who had already blown their cover, before finally, your own image appears in the air.\n\n'And lastly, of course,' you say, 'there is [Root.GetFullName], head of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Intelligence, a most dastardly traitor who has you in [Root.GerHerHis] sights even now.'\n\n[Root.Liege.GetFullName] panics as realization dawns in [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] eyes, and makes for the door, but your agents already have [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] surrounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP220;I recommend you give yourself up. There's no escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP221;You are sitting in the situation room in your bunker, when [From.GetFullName] arrives with a small [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] escort to give you a security briefing. [From.GetSheHeCap] smiles as [From.GetSheHe] sets up the holotank and begins cycling through the identities of known traitors.\n\nYou nod as [From.GetSheHe] explains what's known of each of them to you - none of it is particularly new information, unfortunately. Until, finally, it settles on a surprising image.\n\n'And lastly, of course,' [From.GetSheHe] says, 'there is [From.GetFullName], head of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Intelligence, a most dastardly traitor who has you in [From.GerHerHis] sights even now.'\n\nYou become acutely aware of just how many guns are trained on you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP221;You treacherous bastard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
