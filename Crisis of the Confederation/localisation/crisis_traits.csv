full_cybernetic_conversion_desc;This character's entire biological body has been replaced with an artificial one - neurological continuity has been maintained, but every element of the host body is now fully cybernetic. While this procedure is entirely possible with modern surgical and electronics technology, common opinions of it range from 'extremely creepy' to 'abominable desecration of the human form' - even most dedicated Cyberneticists find full-body conversions to be at least somewhat disturbing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hiver_implant;Hiver Implant;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hiver_implant_desc;This character has been implanted with a Hiver Implant, a variation on the Direct Neural Interface that acts a direct connection to a distributed interstellar wireless network known as the Hive. The Hive is supposedly a gestalt of the many individuals that make it up, but suffers from a critical design flaw - it is incapable of reconciling the vast diversity of contrasting personalities and identities of its drones, and as a direct result, it suffers from severe schizophrenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
