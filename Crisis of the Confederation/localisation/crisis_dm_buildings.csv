ca_primary_q_0;Outpost;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_0_desc;This is little more than a tiny military outpost with rudimentary facilities to support its meager garrison.  All of the soldiers here are temporary residents serving tours of duty.  Any craft here were constructed elsewhere and serious damage to craft cannot be repaired on site.\n\nLevel 1 volatilities required to upgrade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_1;Station;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_1_desc;A small military station capable of supporting a regiment of soldiers as well as construct small craft.  While uncommon, some families do live in these facilities.  A system can't really have any military influence without at least one such station.\n\nLevel 1 metals and launch system required to upgrade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_2;Base;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_2_desc;The galactic standard for military bases.  This facility is fully capable of building capital class ships as well as support the permanent crews of these vessels.  A significant number of civilian homes exist alongside the military factories to staff and support them.\n\nLevel 2 volatilities required to upgrade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_3;Spaceport;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_3_desc;A major center of activity, both militarily and otherwise.  This port goes beyond the basic requirements to build and support fleets, enabling it to support other bases and settlements off world.  Any would be autocrat would want to have at least this level of facility as their seat of power.\n\nLevel 2 metals and launch system required to upgrade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_4;Military Works;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_4_desc;A large collection of various cities and factories, largely focused on the production of space faring craft and ordinance.  These works are now large enough to serve as a command center for a war effort.  Any citizen living nearby a military base of this magnitude can't help but feel a certain sense of dread from the power it represents.\n\nLevel 3 volatilities, metals, and launch system required to upgrade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_5;War Complex;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_primary_q_5_desc;The crowning jewel of humanity's potential for destruction.  This complex represents a full planet, a set of moons, or a number of space stations dedicated to the creation of vessels of war.  Something that could keep a Galactic Empire at bay, or the force that could bring one about.\n\n No further upgrades to the primary building are possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fighter_hanger_q_1;Fighter Hangar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fighter_hanger_q_1_desc;This small hanger is used to store, repair, and launch small one-man fighter craft designed to escort and provide support to larger vessels.  The most common of these craft are the R20-Stinger "human-torpedo" fighter.  Despite it's nickname, many Stinger pilots claim they feel safer inside it then anywhere else.  This isn't baseless faith, as this reliable design has been in use for nearly a century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
