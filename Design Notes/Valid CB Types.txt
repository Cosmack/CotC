VALID CBS
	- Claim CBs
	- De Jure CBs
	- Crusades (limited to certain ideologies)
	- Invasions (again, limited to certain ideologies)
	- Embargoes
	- Revolt Against The Tyranny of yadda yadda yadda (the one when they refuse to give up a title)
		These work as in vanilla.
	
	- Reprisals
		This is a time-limited (10 years) CB against rulers who have recently attacked you. It allows you to invade and take:
			- One neighboring province (if they are a count or duke)
			- One neighboring duchy (if they are a king or emperor)
		An "attack" is defined as:
			- A declaration of war (except for military campaigns)
			- Exposed hostile plots (e.g., assassinations)
			- Raids on you or your territories
		The first reprisal type doesn't help much against independents rulers, as it will expire before the truce does. It does, however, allow you to escalate a war.
	
	- Cultural Liberation
		This CB allows you to conquer a neighboring province that shares your culture group, but not its owner's.
	
	- Holy War
		Operates identically to vanilla Holy War. Available only to Orthodox, Solarian, Xenoterran, Patrist, Matrist, and Machine Cult.
	
	- Rebellions (Democratic, Autoratic, Theocratic)
		The CB types used by rebels.
		
	- Military Campaign
		CB type used by military officers to win their lieges' wars. No truce time.
		
	- Military Occupation
		Military Campaign variant. Targets a title of the military charater's tier or below and gains that title upon success. Must be authorized by the overall war leader. No truce time.
		
	- Civil War
		CB type for most civil wars. Non-independence, non-revolt civil wars are always the result of a failed coup (which in turn may be the result of a constitutional crisis, which is the result of the sort of thing that usually causes civil wars in vanilla)
		
	- War of Independence
		Exactly what it says on the tin.
		
	- War of Aggression
		Free CB to conquer one neighboring province. Available only to Astrism, Terran Imperialism
