EVTDESCCOUP0;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [FROM.GetFullName]\nRE: New management\nIt's time we brought this farce to a close. You are no longer fit to serve as [Root.GetTitle]. We demand that you tender your immediate resignation. If you've any love left for the people you've betrayed, you'll stand down, and spare them death at the hands of your butchers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCOUP10;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetFullName]\nRE: New management\nYou win, you snake. For the sake of peace, I hereby surrender the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] to you. May its people forgive me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP11;'Breaking news from the [From.Location.GetName] System tonight, as sources claim that [From.GetFullName] has unexpectedly resigned. [From.GetSheHeCap] explicitly named [From.GetHerHis] longstanding rival, [FromFrom.GetFullName] as acting leader of the new government, amidst accusations of foul play...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP12;It appears that your plot has succeeded beyond your wildest dreams. [FromFrom.GetFullName] has resigned from office and surrendered to [From.GetFullName], and all without firing a shot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP20;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetFullName]\nRE: New management\nNever! Even if you tear [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] asunder, you'll never be able to do as much damage to my people with missiles as you could with my title. You and your followers are traitors, and will be dealt with as such.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP20;...damn, I was really hoping that would work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP100;You've already made the first move - and it failed. It's too late to turn back now. There's no possible way you could defend your actions to [Root.PlotTarget.GetFullName], and you have no doubt that you'll be under arrest within the hour if you don't act immediately. The only options left are surrender and civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP100;Then war it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCOUP100;No, civil war is too high a price to pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCOUP101;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetFullName]\nRE: New Management\nI had thought you a better [Root.GetWomanMan] than this. Just remember, this war is on your head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP102;Your initial strike failed, and [From.PlotTarget.GetFullName] is definitely onto you now. [From.GetFullName] has issued official orders proclaiming [From.GetHerselfHimself] the acting leader of the [From.PlotTarget.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], and has ordered all government institutions to join [From.GetHerHim] in overthrowing the corrupt leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCOUP103;It has come to war at last. [From.GetFullName] has openly declared [From.GetHerselfHimself] the rightful ruler of the [From.PlotTarget.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], and has called on all of [From.GetHerHis] supporters to assist [From.GetHerHim] in removing [From.PlotTarget.GetFullName] from office.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP103;Make ready the fleet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCOUP103;I can do more damage by pretending I'm still loyal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCOUP120;Tracer beams glitter in the dark skies over the third world of the [Root.Location.GetName] System. This battle could potentially decide the outcome of the civil war, and your squadron is currently heading toward the worst of the fighting.

EVTDESCCOUP121;Things are beginning to look bleak, as yet another squadron of Loyalist reinforcements jump in, led by a ship you recognize as the [From.Religon.GetRandomEvilGodName], [From.GetFullName]'s flagship. You are about to order a missile salvo when they open fire - on the other Loyalists. Your crew cheers as Loyalist ships explode.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
